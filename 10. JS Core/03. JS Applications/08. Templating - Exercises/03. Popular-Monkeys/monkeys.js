    info: "Chim Chim and Speed Racer's kid brother Spritle provide the comic relief on this classic cartoon. Their relationship is a strong (if not a little bizarre) one; they're essentially joined at the hip, and they consistently rock matching outfits as they plot new, wacky ways to get their hands on some candy."

    info: "Abu is sort of like Aladdin’s version of a Greek chorus, constantly pulling faces and reacting to the action and occasionally uttering a word here or there in a Donald Duck-style voice. Can you blame him? He’s got a lot to deal with, like being turned into an elephant against his will."

    info: "All good things must come to an end, and Marcel's time on Friends was no exception. Everyone's favorite 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'-obsessed Capuchin monkey got donated to a zoo by Ross after he began humping everything in sight. Later Ross finds out that Marcel was stolen from the zoo and is starring in a movie."
