                        language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed,
                        prototype-based and
                        multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the
                        World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web
                        applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated
                        JavaScript engine to execute it. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports
                        event-driven,
                        functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles.
                        It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation
                        of the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or
                        graphics
                        facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.</p>
